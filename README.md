# CSV analyser IOT data

## Prelude
This tool was originally designed for the **Embedded System Security course (ELEC-H550)**, given at the *Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles*.

It was designed by a group comprising Martin Devolder, Virgile Devolder and Corentin Bouffioux.

## Prerequisites

### Python
To use this tool, you need Python installed on your system. Ensure you have Python version 3.7 or later. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setting up the Environment

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies effectively and avoid conflicts.

#### On Windows:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
`python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
`venv\Scripts\activate`

#### On macOS/Linux:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
`python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
`source venv/bin/activate`

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command ensures all the necessary libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib, are installed.

### Running the Scripts
Each Python script can be executed using the following command:

```bash
python <file_name>.py
```
Replace <file_name> with the actual name of the script you want to run. For example:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available at [SmartSense on GitHub](https://github.com/snudatalab/SmartSense).

## How to Use the Dataset:
1. Download the dataset from the repository.
2. Unzip the data folder.
3. Place the unzipped data folder in the root directory of this project.

The tool will automatically recognize and process the dataset files from the data folder.
